          <h2>Definition of a triangle</h3>
          <p>A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted {\displaystyle \triangle ABC} \triangle ABC. <strong> For more information about triangle</strong> <em> click here</em><a href = "https://www.mathsisfun.com/triangle.html"> Description on Triangles</a></p>
        
          <h2>Types of triangle</h2>
          <p>there are many types of triangle but here in our project we are going to describe three only.</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Equilateral</li>
          <li>Isosceles</li>
          <li>Scalene</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="equilateral">
            <h3>Equilateral triangle</h3>
            <img src="https://www.ducksters.com/kidsmath/triangle_equilateral.gif" height="200" width="200">
            <p>is a triangle in which all three sides are equal. In the familiar Euclidean geometry, an equilateral triangle is also equiangular; that is, all three internal angles are also congruent to each other and are each 60Â°. It is also a regular polygon, so it is also referred to as a regular triangle.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Isosceles">
          <h3>Isosceles triangle</h3>
          <img src="http://www.webquest.hawaii.edu/kahihi/mathdictionary/images/acutetriangle.png" height="200" width="200">
          <p> isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two sides of equal length. Sometimes it is specified as having exactly two sides of equal length, and sometimes as having at least two sides of equal length.</p>
        </div>
         <div id="Scalene">
            <h3>Scalene triangle?</h3>
            <img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yJnVPxnEIl0/UAyax2OZWjI/AAAAAAAAAHU/UfZncaSH1Bo/s1600/tri%C3%A1ngulo+obtus%C3%A1ngulo.jpg" height="200" width="200">
            <p>A scalene triangle is a triangle with all sides of different lengthst, All angles are different, too, So no sides are equal and no angles are equal.</p>
