            <p>Equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal. In the familiar Euclidean geometry, an equilateral triangle is also equiangular; that is, all three internal angles are also congruent to each other and are each 60Â°. It is also a regular polygon, so it is also referred to as a regular triangle.</p>
